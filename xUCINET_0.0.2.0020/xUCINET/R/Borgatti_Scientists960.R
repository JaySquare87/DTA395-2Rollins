#' Collaboration among 960 scientists.
#'
#' These data indicate the amount of time (in days, and rounded to the nearest day) that scientists at a large applied research institute worked on projects together. The data are derived from a 2-mode matrix (960 persons by 3154 projects) in which the cells indicated how much time each scientist worked on each project. The 1-mode projection was achieved by the sum of minimums method. For example, if person A spent 1 day on project 1 and 3 days on project 2, and person B spent 5 days on project 1 and 2 days on project 2, the amount of time worked together is 1+2 = 3 days.
