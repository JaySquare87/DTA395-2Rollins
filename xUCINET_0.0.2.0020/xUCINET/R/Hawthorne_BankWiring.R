#' Interactions among employees in a bank wiring room (Hawthorne plant).
#'
#' These are the observational data on 14 Western Electric (Hawthorne Plant) employees from the bank wiring room first presented in Roethlisberger & Dickson (1939). The data are better known through a scrutiny made of the interactions in Homans (1950), as well as the CONCOR analysis presented in Breiger et al (1975). The employees worked in a single room and include two inspectors (I1 and I3), three solderers (S1, S2 and S3), and nine wiremen or assemblers (W1 to W9). Contains six types of interactions among employees.
